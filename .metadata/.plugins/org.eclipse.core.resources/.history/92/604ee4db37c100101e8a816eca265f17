/*Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array.
 
Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.
 
Constraint 1: You are NOT allowed to sort the array in any way.
 
Constraint 2: There may be duplicates in the array.
 
Constraint 3: You can have an empty array(print -1 in that case) as well as an array with negative numbers
 
Example 1:

Input: [1,2,4,7,7,5]

Output: Second Smallest : 2

Second Largest : 5

Explanation: The elements are as follows 1,2,4,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2.
 
Example 2:

Input: [2]

Output: Second Smallest : -1

Second Largest : -1

Explanation: Since there is only one element in the array, it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. There is no second largest or second smallest element present.
